# SMART-SYSTEM-MONITOR-USING-C
The objective of this project is to design and implement a lightweight, real-time system monitoring tool using C++ and the ncurses library that provides users with a professional and interactive terminal-based interface to visualize system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and process-level statistics.
This project aims to enhance understanding of Linux systems programming, process management, and terminal user interface design by leveraging the /proc filesystem to fetch real-time process information and dynamically display it using color-coded alerts. The system highlights high CPU and memory usage processes through visual indicators (green, yellow, red) and allows users to interactively sort, monitor, and terminate processes directly from the console.
By combining efficiency with simplicity, the SMART SYSTEM MONITOR demonstrates how low-level system data can be transformed into a user-friendly visual dashboard, replicating functionalities of standard Linux utilities like top or htop—but fully implemented from scratch. This strengthens the developer’s grasp on resource monitoring, signal handling, multi-layer architecture, and real-time visualization in Linux environments.
